# AVR-Mine_Detector_Car

Mine Detector Car is a Bluetooth-controlled robotic vehicle equipped with a front
mounted metal detector sensor. The car moves via a mobile application and 
automatically stops when metal is detected. The sensor triggers an internal buzzer upon 
detection, and the car remains halted until manually reversed by the user.
